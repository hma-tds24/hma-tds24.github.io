<h1>Journal</h1>

<!-- Journal Entry 1 -->
<p>
	This is how I put things online. I got to the terminal and a type (if I'm not already in my folder):<br>
	<br>cd ./desktop/Hma-tds.github.io

	<br>git add .
	<br>git commit -m "whatever you are doing"

	<br>git push
</p>

<p>Event listeners-12/10/2024
We created an object that can switch between two colors when click
We used if else statements, lightswitches and true false statements to loop these events.</p>
<p>Code Review- 2/27/2025
Over the past week, we tested our existing knowledge of cs code. Today we reviewed our work. I felt comfortable with the majority of concepts and enjoyed refreshing my memory of one's I had forgotten such as working the "terminal."</p>
<p>inputs- 3/6/25
	 Today, we reviwed the concept of an input, or a placeholder. I'm still unsure of exactly how it works outside of coding terms but I'll try to describe it: Inputs/placeholders can be used to adress a variable(such as "i") before it is defined. Today we used inputs to address creating a list of ten boxes, in which, one box expands upon a click. To addrss each individual box with seperate ids, we used placeholders to generate the id. we would then create a seperate function to expand the generated div.
